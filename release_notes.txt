Simple Parallel Analyzer noclock V1.0
-------------------------------------

Plugin for Saleae Logic Software. Analyzer for parallel data communication
without a clock signal. The data word transmitted is re-evaluated on every
data transition.

Based on
    SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-1.1.32.zip
    SaleaeAnalyzerSource-1.1.32.zip SimpleParallelAnalyzer

Works with
    Logic+Setup+1.1.31.exe

Project for
    Visual Studio 2013 (Version 12.0)
    Win32 Debug and Release (build but not tested)
    x64   Debug and Release (works for me)
    Run-time library statically linked.
    Compiles and links without warnings or errors.

Installation
    Copy SimpleParallelNoClock.dll from Win32\Release or x64\Release to
    c:\Program Files\Saleae LLC\Analyzers. (Re)start Logic.exe.
    The new analyzer will automatically be loaded and show up in the list
    of analyzers as 'Simple Parallel noclock' right below the included
    'Simple Parallel'.

Known problems
    Displaying the data words above the waveform often needs a manual
    triggered isplay refresh (by e.g. zooming in/out).
    The very last data word is not displayed above the waveform. It is
    visible in the lower right 'Decoded Protocols' pane, though.
    Crashes if analyzer settings do not match the actual channel setup.
    Debugging does not work. Starting Logic.exe from Visual Studio or
    trying to attach the debugger to the already running process crashes.
